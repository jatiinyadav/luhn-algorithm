# Credit Card Checksum Validation 🏦
This repository contains implementations of a credit card checksum validation algorithm across multiple programming languages. The algorithm used is the Luhn algorithm, which is commonly employed to validate credit card numbers.

## Algorithm Overview 🔍
The Luhn algorithm (or "modulus 10" algorithm) is a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, especially credit card numbers. The algorithm works by:

1. Doubling every second digit from the right (starting with the second-to-last digit) 🔢.
2. Subtracting 9 from any result that is greater than 9 ✂️.
3. Summing all the digits ➕.
4. Checking if the total sum is divisible by 10 🔄.
5. If the total sum is divisible by 10, the credit card number is considered valid ✅.

## Implementations 🛠️
This repository includes implementations of the Luhn algorithm in the following programming languages:

- Python 🐍
- Java ☕
- C# 🔧
- JavaScript 💎
- Go 🚀
- Rust 🦀

Each implementation provides a function to validate a credit card number using the Luhn algorithm.
